				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p><a href="http://www.spaceapegames.com">Space Ape Games</a> approached us at <a href="http://www.albion.co">Albion</a> and asked us to create a landing page for their new mobile game: Rival Kingdoms. The brief was loose and allowed us to have free reign on how we thought the experience for the site should work as well, which we later decided to keep simple as a one page design.</p>
				<p>The site went live on the end of February 2015 at <a href="http://rivalkingdoms.com">rivalkingdoms.com</a>.</p>

				<h2>UX Wireframes &amp; Flows</h2>
				<p>The primary KPI's for Space Ape were for social shares. We had to look into integrating both Facebook and Twitter into the site, in a way that didn't feel gimmicky. From there we had to bring people back to the site in the near future, which is a challenge for a promotional website.</p>
				<p>Our solution to this was to create a feedback loop that rewarded users when they shared content on the site that was of interest to them. By sharing certain content at certain times, they were to be credited with in-game currency when the game launched. After a share had been registered, they would be sent an email confirming their reward and prompting them to return to the site to share new content when it was unlocked.</p>
				<p>Wireframes were kept simple, with the website being kept to a single page. Breakpoints for all primary sizes were catered for.</p>

				<h2>Visual Design</h2>
				<p>Looking at existing competitors, we found them to be mostly similar in style and design. Therefore, stylistically, we wanted to juxtapose the traditional game website design paradigm with a clean-cut over the top interface. Elements were later taken from the website and incorporated into the actual game UI.</p>
				<p>Individual button styles and icons were designed for each of the primary game characters, which each had their own respective sections. This created a personalised style for each character, something which more users could get behind, as sharing one that they cared about would become more personal to them.</p>

				<small>Assets were created and iterated upon for the tech team to implement universally. Design sheets like these were important to get the intricacies across.</small>

				<p>Functionality on the website grew as we progressed on the project and we had to consider load times with the amount of visual imagery, along with video content we were implementing for individual characters and backgrounds of sections.</p>
				<p>Interactive maps and expanding carousels were designed to keep things on the page simple and clean whilst still holding a lot of navigation friendly information.</p>
