			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>We were approached by two young entrepreneurs, Ice Min &amp; Joshua Ng, to create a brand and digital experience for their new Coconut Water brand MightyBee. The brief was to position the brand in a way that differentiated itself in an already saturated market, where even the words 'organic' and 'natural' have become clich√©.</p>
			<p>The market positioning was to focus on higher wealth individuals, in trendy areas such as East London. The product is to be launched in April around the Shoreditch area, and will be available initially on the shelf in Fortnum &amp; Mason, Selfridges and Harrods.</p>

			<h2>Branding process</h2>
			<p>I worked with branding designer <a href="http://www.hs-hwasoo.com">Hwasoo Shim</a> on the project to begin thinking about the brand strategy for MightyBee. From there, we iterated on the design language to carry forward with the launch of their product.</p>
			<p>After the process was complete, we had a full package, from logo design, typography and colour systems, which we could then feed into their digital landscape.</p>

			<h2>Photography</h2>
			<p>Over the course of the months working on the project, we flew over to Rachebury, Thailand to witness the production process ourselves, and get a feel for the history of the company, its values and the product itself.</p>
			<p>From a future thinking perspective, photography was taken of the operation, which then later fed into marketing materials and web assets.</p>

			<h2>UX Process &amp; Brand Strategy</h2>
			<p>The key focus of my role on this project was to create an effective digital plan and user experience. By working along side Ice &amp; Joshua, as well as my colleague Rhodes Edewor-Thorley, we created a strategy that would help them to stand out online, even after our work was done.</p>
			<p>After researching the current market, existing competitors and their current target user groups, we wireframed the website, focusing on a responsive mobile first approach.</p>

			<h2>Visual Design &amp; Development</h2>
			<p>I designed the site for three breakpoints; 480px, 640px &amp; 1400px. As requirements changed, we included a fourth breakpoint at 1024px to cater for errors at that size going down from the fluid 1400px design.</p>
			<p>The site requirements were for a full e-commerce system back-end that the client could amend and add products to at any time. I worked coding a SquareSpace theme built with <a href="https://stripe.com/gb">Stripe</a> and <a href="http://www.moonclerk.com">Moonclerk</a>. SquareSpace was chosen here over solutions like <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">Flask</a> due to it's affordability and ease of use for the client.</p>
